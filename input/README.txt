These are the original input meshes used for the paper "Aggressive Tetrahedral Mesh Improvement," In Proceedings of the 16th International Meshing Roundtable., pages 3-23, Seattle, Washington, October 14-17, 2007, by Bryan Klingner and Jonathan Shewchuk.

Feel free to use the meshes for your own research. Attribution information for each is given below. If you do use them, could you please send me an email: bryan@overt.org

Thanks!

cube1k and cube10k were generated by me using NETGEN.

tfire is created by Carl Ollivier-Goochâ€™s GRUMMP software.

tire, rand1 and rand2 come courtesy of Freitag and Ollivier-Gooch (they are included with the GRUMMP package, which is where I got them).

dragon and cow are generated by Jonathan Shewchuk's isosurface stuffing.

sculpt10kv was generated by Pierre Alliez's implementation of "Variational Tetrahedral Meshing."

staypuft was generated by Adam Bargteil's implementation of "Variational Tetrahedral Meshing."

house2 and P are generated by Jonathan Shewchuk's Pyramid.
